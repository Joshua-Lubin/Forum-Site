# Forum-Site
This was intended to be a site where programmers could share their work, however, I never ended up completing it. By the time I gave up on the project, I had created what was essentially a forum site. Here is a video showing the major functionalities of the site. Unforunately, this video is before I implemented a commenting system. The two major features that this video does not cover are the registration and commenting systems.
